VDR Plugin 'sleeptimer' Revision History
----------------------------------------
2011-07-21: Version 0.8
  - Fixed crashing if a sleeptimer was disabled and within the next 10s
    a new sleeptimer was activated.
  - Updated translations, added use of gettext, correction to vdr's
    historical language support capabilities
  - The first option in the main menu is now 'Shutdown [min]' if there
    is no sleeptimer running at present. With an active sleeptimer the
    first option will be to 'Disable sleeptimer'.
  - Added 'Default Timespan' option to the plugins setup which lets
    the user predefine a default value for 'Shutdown [min]' in the
    main menu.
  - Added Autoswitch function which lets the user switch through a 
    predefined array of values. Especially convenient in combination
    with the use of keymacros. The keys User1-User9 are accepted.
