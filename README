*******************************
*** Command Line Parameters ***
*******************************

The -e parameter temporarily overrides the 'Command' option in the plugins setup. Note
that overriding makes the 'Command' option become unselectable and show the command 
defined at the command line ignoring the value currently stored in setup.conf.

********************
*** Plugin Setup ***
********************

Default Timespan [min]:
-defines the default timespan till shutdown, which is shown in the plugins main menu entry

Action:
-'Shutdown' sends an internal shutdown signal to vdr. Represents exactly the same way
 as if the Power key would be pressed. This way vdr itself handles the shutdown
 procedure, delays the shutdown if needed, sets timers correctly etc.
-'Mute' mutes audio if not already muted
-'Execute command' invokes a system call to 'Command'
-'Command' defines the executable to be invoked on sleeptimer timeout (default: /sbin/poweroff)
 overridden by command line parameter -e. If overriden this option becomes unselectable 
 (see above).

Use Autoswitch with default:
-Integrates the default timespan in the predefined values and makes the Autoswitch function
 start with this value.

Confirm:
-makes the Autoswitch function offer the predefined timespans but does not activate
 the sleeptimer unless the user explicitly confirms by pressing Ok.

*****************
*** Main Menu ***
*****************

Not Active / Disable sleeptimer:
-Allows disabling of an active sleeptimer. If there is no active sleeptimer 'Not Active' is
 displayed.

Shutdown [min]:
-Denotes the timespan for a sleeptimer in minutes. Values < 2 minutes are not allowed. 
 Activation by Ok.

Shutdown (time):
-Denotes the time for a sleeptimer. Values < 2 minutes are not allowd. Activation by Ok.

Red / Autoswitch (inspired by an idea / feature request by grindo):
-Switches through a set of predefined values (min). Especially convenient in combination with
 the use of keymacros. Just add for example
 User7     @sleeptimer Red
 in vdr's keymacros.conf file and make sure User7 is mapped in remote.conf. This makes the
 user switch through the predefined values by just pressing one key and without hassling with
 vdr's main menu. By default the predefined values are:
 Disabling, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180
 In combination with 'Use default for Autoswitch' the 'Default Timespan' value will be
 integrated in this sequence and calling the autoswitch function will start with this
 value.

Green / Disable:
-Disables an active sleeptimer.
